## How to setup StackEdit
Open https://stackedit.io/app
Create a new Workspace pointing to "main" branch of "https://github.com/lbke/research".
If hitting a 400 issue, use this trick: https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/1755#issuecomment-918949789

StackEdit is able to publish the files as HTML.
Then, use HTML preview to create HTML links: https://htmlpreview.github.io/ and tinyurl to have a clean link.

### How to publish

- Use "Synchronize" to save the markdown version
- Use "Publish" to turn it into HTML /!\ don't forget to rename the file to .html!!
